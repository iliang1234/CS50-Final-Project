First, make sure you are in the correct location to access all files necessary to run the user interface. If not, use the “cd” command to get yourself to where the files are all located. Then, in order to run the entire website UI, type out “Flask run” in the terminal window.

Our homepage contains a textbox for you to enter in a sentence, along with a submit button for you to press when you’re ready. Then, you should be redirected to another HTML page containing a list of songs (and their respective artists), with every song containing one word from the inputted sentence.

There are two links on the homepage, one that does the above, and one that does something similar. The second link also has a textbox for you to enter a sentence, but instead of forming a list of songs, you will be redirected to another HTML page containing a list of artists (with each artist containing one word from the sentence input).
